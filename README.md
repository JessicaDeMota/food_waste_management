# Food Waste Management Report 

##  Why Food Waste?

 - Food Waste Management is a disruption to ground - water pollution. 
 - Many people stock-piled food during the midst of the pandemic due to high levels of anxiety, due to lack of security of jobs.
- Food sales during COVID in grocery stores were scarce, and restaurants faced a lack of sales. 
- Households are the largest contributor to food waste. 
- Joe Biden has concentrated his time to create a more sustainable environment during his presidency. 
- More than 550 community and environmental advocacy groups, led in part by the Center for Biological Diversity, are urging President-elect Joe Biden to take a series of actions in eight areas that could reduce plastics entering the waste stream, place new limitations on how they're managed and stimulate market demand. 

##  Department of Sanitation Tonnage Data:

### About This DataSet :

The Department of Sanitation updates the amount of waste per borough in NYC, since 1990. It has each waste separated into different categories. The last time it was updated was on March, 8th, 2021 and made public on February 12th of 2014. The different categories into which the dataset is separated into based on different kinds of waste are refusal of tons collected, paper tons collected, mpg tons collected, resorganic tons collected, school organic tons, leaves organic tons, xmas street tons. The one’s I am exploring within this project are school organic tons, refuse tons collected, and  resorganic tons as they specifically focus on food waste. 

## Community Fridges Dataset:

### About This Dataset:

Freedges is the database that is used for the collection of community fridges. In NYC, many fridges were implemented during COVID, creating a total of 108 fridges in NYC. Due to the fact that many undocument immigrants aren’t applicable to SNAP, and many New Yorkers can’t go to reach for certain food bank locations. 

## Goals:

- Did Food Waste Management Improve During COVID -19 in NYC?
- How Bad Was Food Waste Management Before COVID -19 in NYC ?
- What Boroughs Have The Best Food Waste Management ?
- Did Andrew Cuomo's 4.3 Million in Grants to Reduce Food Waste Actually Make Changes ?
- How Did Community Fridges Impact Food Waste ?

## Libraries/ Modules  Used:

Numpy = This is used for working with arrays and matrices, often used for data analysis and machine learning. 

Pandas =  Stands for Python Data Analysis Library, and allows to manipulate datasets with other implementations it has within the libraries and algorithms already set up. 

DateTime = A module that supplies dates and times 

Pandas_Profiling =  Pandas Profiling is an open source Python module that is used to make 
explanatory analysis, it generates interactive reports into html. 

MatPlotLib =  Matplotlib is used for interactive visualizations that are static and animated 

Json =  Exposes an API familiar to users. This library parses JSON into a Python dictionary or list, it can convert Python dictionaries into JSON strings. 

Seaborn =  Data Visualization library that is based on matplotlib, and used to make random distributions. 

## Hypothesis:

During COVID - 19, food waste management improved due to more implementations of community fridges,less business and schools being open. There was also less food waste in some boroughs due to food insecurity. 

## Errors in Our Dataset:

- Although it is for food waste management, they also combine much of the data with other types of waste. 
- There was a lot of null data for a whole month, showing that the department of sanitation isn't collectivizing data for certain months or there aren't many departments of sanitation workers in certain boroughs. 

## Conclusions Drawn :

- This data can be utilized to make decisions on food waste management and utilizing 
  management in specific boroughs. 
- With more app implemented in New York, such as Too Good To Go, that are now impacting the way restaurants even look at their management, it will allow us to concentrate on the specific ways we utilize waste. 
- Also help Joe Biden's plan on sustainability and stakeholders looking into Waste Management Inc. Decisions would be made on how much further to invest into sanitation, sanitation workers, and distributing better choices in how much grocery stores, etc can maintain to reduce waste management.
